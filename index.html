            <h2>KPop</h2>
            <p>
                I was first introduce to KPop in my senior year of highschool. It was in my sculpture, We were allowed to watch or listen music videos while create drafts.
                I noticed a very colorful scene and handsome men on the screen and it peaked my interest. The next time I this group was at New Year's Eve countdown show and I had to look into the group of boys.
                The next thing I know I fell in love with the group called BTS. I am obsessed with them. This also was how I met my current best friend when I was in college!
                We have been best friends ever since. We also met our second best friend too because of KPop! We even enjoy different groups now!
                KPop is a now more part of my life than I would have ever dreamed about. I made many new friends because of this! KPop is who I am and I am glad for it.
